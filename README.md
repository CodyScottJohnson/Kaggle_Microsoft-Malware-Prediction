## Getting Started

### Pipenv
The project uses pipenv to manage dependancies it you are using a mac with homebrew you can install pipenv by running

```bash
brew install pipenv
```

Otherwise follow the instructions found at [Installing Pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/#installing-pipenv)

### Install Dependancies

pipenv will create a virtuall environment and install all dependancies

```bash
pipenv install
````

### Setup
Copy `sample.env` into a new file name `.env` and replace `KAGGLE_USERNAME` and `KAGGLE_KEY` with your username and key 
> To use the Kaggle API, sign up for a Kaggle account at https://www.kaggle.com. Then go to the 'Account' tab of your user profile (https://www.kaggle.com/<username>/account) and select 'Create API Token'. This will trigger the download of kaggle.json, a file containing your API credentials.

Run setup.py to download dataset and perform initial setup

```bash
pipenv run python setup.py init
```
The initial setup will download data files from kaggle and unpack in the data folder. 
>By default the original zip files won't be deleted this is useful since it allows you to use kaggles api to check for updates. However if you are short on space you can pass the `--delete-zip` flag to delete the zip files after unpacking

```bash
pipenv run python setup.py init --delete-zip
```

For Additional help run

```bash
$pipenv run python setup.py --help

Usage: setup.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  This script performs basic setup operations such  as downloading data and
  starting a development  environment in jupyter.

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  init   Downloads data from kaggle and starts Jupyter server
  serve  Starts Jupyter server
```

## Development

### Starting Jupyter

To start jupyter without redownloading data files run

```bash
pipenv run python setup.py serve
```
If you don't want to start a jupyter server from withing the virtual environment, and instead want to make the virtual environment available on your local jupyter server or in applications like Spyder you can run

```bash
$pipenv shell
$python -m ipykernel install --user --name=Kaggle_Microsoft-Malware-Prediction
```

### Adding New Packages

In order to allow pipenv to manage the dependancies `pipenv` should be used to install packages instead of `pip`

```bash
pipenv install <name-of-package>
```
